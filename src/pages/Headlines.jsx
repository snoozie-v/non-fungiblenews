          <p><date>9/19/23 - </date> 
          Here are a few ways to protect yourself and your assets.<br/><br/>

üö® NEVER give your keys out.<br/>
üö® Never connect to a dApp that you have not verified. <br/>
üö® Use a cold wallet. <br/>
üö® Make trades with a secondary, empty wallet.<br/><br/>

If it sounds too good to be true, it is.
